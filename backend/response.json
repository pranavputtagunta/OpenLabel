    "feedback": "The salad bowl appears to be a good source of vegetables, which aligns with your goal to eat more vegetables. However, the appropriateness depends on the specific ingredients. It's important to ensure the salad is gluten-free and does not contain pecans or peanuts. Also, be mindful of added sugars in dressings or other components to meet your goal of reducing sugar intake. The salad bowl can be a healthy option if you customize it to fit your dietary needs and preferences.",
